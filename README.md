### Usage
Allows users to efficently keep track of items in their current grocery list. Items that are bought with every grocery trip can be saved as recurring and will persist. 

### Future Plans
- Add a recipe feature that finds or recommends recipes (ex, from /r/recipes) and ads required ingredients into your current grocery list
    - TODO: Create backend service that pulls top recipe from /r/recipes and parses ingredients list
    
- Add user account functionality that stores current grocery list and previous saved lists to cloud

- Create a backend service that dynamic updates the total price of your current grocery list and the nearest supermarkets to you
    - TODO: Find/Create API that returns real time pricing of common grocery items
